# JSI — Java Shellcode Injector  
### Runner & Payload Builder Framework

**JSI (Java Shellcode Injector)** is a lightweight red-team framework for **generating** and **executing** shellcode payloads using:

- **Donut** — converts EXE/DLL/.NET tools into position-independent shellcode  
- **JSI Java Loader** — executes payloads fully in memory with no EXE execution  

This toolchain enables execution of offensive and diagnostic tooling in highly restricted environments, achieving **100% AppLocker bypass** and **loader-level EDR evasion**.

---

## 🚀 Key Capabilities

### ✔ 100% AppLocker Bypass
All payloads run **in-memory via Java**, not as external executables.  
This completely bypasses Applocker and application control policies.

### ✔ Loader-Level EDR Bypass
The JSI Loader:

- Allocates RWX memory via JNA  
- Injects shellcode directly  
- Executes it inside the Java process  
- Avoids EXE creation events and many user‑mode hooks  

⚠ Detection depends on the payload itself, but the loader stage reliably evades most EDR heuristics.

---

## 🧪 Supported Payloads

Not every EXE converts cleanly into Donut shellcode.  
However, the following have been fully validated to work:

- **Nuclei**  
- **PingCastle**  
- **Mimikatz**  
- Common .NET tooling (Rubeus, SharpHound, Seatbelt, etc.)

## 🔨 Payload Generation Example (Donut)

Real payload creation example:

```
./donut.exe -i .\Rubeus.exe -p "currentluid" -a 2 -o payload.bin -z 3 -e 3 -t 5
```

Breakdown:

- `-i` → input binary  
- `-p` → arguments passed to payload  
- `-a 2` → AMD64  
- `-o` → output shellcode  
- `-z 3` → compression  
- `-e 3` → entropy/encryption  
- `-t 5` → exit thread  

---

## 🧱 Components

### **1. MakePayload.bat — Donut Wrapper**
Simplifies Donut usage by providing:

- Automatic naming (`<binary>.bin`)  
- Random filename mode via `-r`  
- Argument embedding  

Examples:

```
.\MakePayload.bat Rubeus.exe currentluid
```

Randomized:

```
.\MakePayload.bat Rubeus.exe currentluid -r
```

---

### **2. JSI Java Shellcode Runner**
Loads and executes Donut payloads entirely in memory.

Usage:

```
.\runner.bat .\Rubeus.bin currentluid
```

Runner actions:

- Loads shellcode  
- Allocates RWX memory  
- Executes payload  
- Writes logs to run_output.txt  

---

## 🛠 Compiling the Java Loader

Use Java 8 compatible bytecode for maximum compatibility.

```
javac -cp "jna-5.13.0.jar" --release 8 ShellcodeRunner.java
```

Notes:

- JNA version may vary  
- `--release 8` ensures Java 8 compatibility  
- Add more JARs using `-cp` if needed

## Summary

**JSI — Java Shellcode Injector**  
A powerful, compact framework for:

- Building shellcode payloads with Donut  
- Executing payloads in-memory via Java  
- Bypassing AppLocker and evading many EDR detections  
- Running tools like Nuclei, PingCastle, and Mimikatz **without dropping EXEs**  

A practical example of modern, stealthy in-memory execution for red-team operations and security research.
